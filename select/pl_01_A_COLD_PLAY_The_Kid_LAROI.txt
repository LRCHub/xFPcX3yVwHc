Who was I to think that I could fix you, baby?
(Who?)
Who would I be if I didn't miss you, baby? (Who)
I hope that you know you were appreciated
Around my house, I still got up all of our
pictures, baby, mm
'Cause I still love you, that's how I feel at my
core
Flew different states to come see you in between
tour
I gave you everything I had and even more
Just understand it's not like me to give my
heart away, ayy
Now you takin' distance and it's hard to take,
ayy
I tried everything to get your thoughts to
change, ayy
I tried not to listen when they all would say,
ayy
This was temporary and you'd walk away
It'll always be easy to blamе you
But it's my fault for thinking I could
Fix you, fix you, fix you, fix you
Fix you, fix you, fix you, wish I could
Miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you
It's really hard to accept the fact that I can't
Fix you, fix you, fix you, fix you
Fix you, fix you, fix you, wish I could
Miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you
It's rеally hard to accept the fact I can't fix
you now
You said to me, baby, you was all in
I think we just probably should've stayed
friends
I think that we probably could've saved tears
(And saved years)
Just understand it's not like me to give my
heart away, ayy
Now you takin' distance and it's hard to take,
ayy
I tried everything to get your thoughts to
change, ayy
I tried not to listen when they all would say,
ayy
This was temporary and you'd walk away
It'll always be easy to blame you
But it's my fault for thinking I could
Fix you, fix you, fix you, fix you
Fix you, fix you, fix you, wish I could
Miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you
It's really hard to accept the fact that I can't
Fix you, fix you, fix you, fix you
Fix you, fix you, fix you, wish I could
Miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you
It's really hard to accept the fact I can't fix
you, now
